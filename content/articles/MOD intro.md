# This is weird
###### This system is weird. The word weird stems from the old English for the ability to control fate. I cannot fully explain how it works yet but I will be fleshing out the extent of my knowledge as the blog evolves.

###### Reality is not limited to the perception that you have been handed since you have been born. Quantum physics states that anything observed is not unaffected by the observer therefore you are creating your reality simply by observing it. Every observation / measurement changes the thing that is being observed / measured. You are actively creating your reality and have been your entire life.

## Map Of The Dreamer (MOD)
###### Map of the dreamer MOD for short is a new non-linear cosmological map/model that puts you at the center of your own universe. You can think of this system as an open source and modular starter kit. If you don't have a word for something you cannot experience that thing. This will provide symbols, concepts and tools that can be used to change and rearrange the reality that you currently experience. Giving you the seeds needed to cultivate within yourself in order to grow your own reality. Inner being outer seeing as I like to say. 

###### This system will incorporate many mystical and cosmological models such as the chakras, the astrological planets, the different elements, hermetics as well as different thought-forms and energies and much more that you can interface with. It meets you at your level of understanding and allows you to evolve and the system of evolves with you. As I flesh out the details you will begin to understand why these things are important and how they are useful in changing and rearranging the reality that you experience currently. This system is only for those who are willing to take full responsibility for control over their lives. Not for the weak-hearted or weak minded.  Are you ready to actively change your life in ways that suit you or continue to be spoon-fed reality by the current narrative? Stay tuned and learn how to take charge of the reality you experience.
