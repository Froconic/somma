# Welcome to the blog! 
###### I created this space to gather all of my knowledge and thoughts on anything under the categories mind body soul. I believe we are a complex system the universe created that utilizes those three components in order to individuate and experience itself. In my pursuit to understand and explore the universe with the faculties we all share I have discovered many things. In order to truly understand and integrate these things myself I have to articulate them completly. If you cannot articulate you cannot integrate as they say. So here on this blog I will collect my thoughts. This also allows me to get these thoughts out of my head and into a space that others can interact with them.

###### Under mind I will be diving into concepts ranging from quantum mechanics, psychology, sociology, mindfulness, philosophy, metaprogramming and much more.

###### Under body we will explore nutrition, moving meditation, martial arts, the body's capabilities and intelligence, anatomy and wellness and health in general.

###### Under soul we will explore magic, occult esotericsm, creativity, mythology, energy systems, cosmologies, astrology and other systems to know the soul in its totality.

###### My aim is for the concepts and thoughts collected here to add to your own knowledge. In doing so planting seeds that can be cultivated to eventually flourish in order to evolve your reality
