title: Moon Portal
description: I made this based off a technique of meditating on an image before bed to help increase lucid dreaming. The journey starts by being at the edge of the water. Swimming towards the stairs. As you get closer your body relxes more and more as the water washes away all your worries. When you reach the stairs and climb onto the first step you notice a cup on a pillar to your side. You drink from the cup and as you drink from it your body and mind fully sink into deep relaxation. All your worries and excess energies have been washed away. Now you are ready to acsend the staircase. Reaching the door in the center of the moon you pause before opening the doors seeing the cosmos behind the threshold. You step forth into the abyss of space and drift up and away.....
