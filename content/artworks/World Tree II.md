title: World Tree II
description: This is an image I made in order to better visualize my world tree grounding and centering meditation. The green orb below is the center of the Earth to connect and send excess energy to ground and bring up healing energy through the roots. The white orb is the sun and the branches reach out to receive the light. With you at the center being the bridge for the two energies to mingle.
